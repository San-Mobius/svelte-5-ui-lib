<h1>Svelte 5 UI Lib: Work in progress</h1>

<p>
    Welcome to Svelte 5 UI Lib - an experimental UI library project crafted for personal use with Svelte 5. The design is based on Flowbite. While you're welcome to utilize it, please note that it was designed with a limited set of components, and I regret that I am unable to provide any support. However, your suggestions are always welcome!
